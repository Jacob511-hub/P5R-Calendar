## Description

- This is a webpage designed for players of Persona 5 Royal to view information pertaining to the games various dates and activities in order to better plan how they want to approach the game themselves, as well provide a convenient resource for any information the player may want to know while playing, such as answers to certain questions or dialogue options.
- Persona 5 Royal is a game where the player has a finite amount of time to participate in various optional activities that assist in their progression, with certain activities only being available at certain times, or become completely unavailable after a certain point or if certain conditions are not met. Certain optional choices may also accelerate this progress or unlock certain features. However, new players will not always be aware of how best to use their time or what the best choices to make are.
- While resources for these choices and optimizations exist online, what this tool aims to achieve is to present all of that information in a quick, easy-to-read format that can all be found on a single page so that a player looking for a specific piece of information does not have to search for it elsewhere.
